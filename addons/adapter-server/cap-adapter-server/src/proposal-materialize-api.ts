/**
 * Proposal code-materialization REST endpoint — G5 Phase 4 (live wiring).
 *
 * Adds `POST /api/proposals/:id/materialize`: an on-demand path that takes a
 * DRAFT proposal and generates the irreducibly-code parts of its changes (today
 * the `ActionDefinition.handler` body) via a `CodeGenerationProvider` over the
 * configured AI provider, build-checks the output (Phase 2 syntax gate), and
 * attaches the candidate source to each change as `generatedSource`.
 *
 * SAFETY BOUNDARY (do NOT cross — see CLAUDE.md "AI Never Modifies Production Directly"):
 *   - DRAFT-only. A non-draft proposal is refused with a 422 and nothing is
 *     generated or written. Materialization is meaningful only before review.
 *   - Candidate source ONLY. The generated code is attached to the draft so it
 *     enters the existing human review pipeline. This endpoint NEVER submits,
 *     validates-to-approve, approves, commits, graduates, writes files, or runs
 *     the generated code. Double human review (draft review + graduation PR)
 *     still gates whether it ever lands.
 *   - ON-DEMAND only. There is NO scheduler / cron / timer that auto-materializes
 *     — cadence is a deferred product decision.
 *   - The permission slot (CommandLayer) is NEVER skipped: it runs FIRST, before
 *     any engine read or AI call, so an unauthorized caller learns nothing (not
 *     even whether the proposal exists).
 *
 * The HTTP handler is a thin shell around the injectable {@link runProposalMaterialization}
 * orchestrator so the core flow can be unit-tested with a fake provider (no real
 * model call). The route mirrors the error envelope, handler shape, and
 * `set.status` discipline of `proposal-graduate-api.ts`.
